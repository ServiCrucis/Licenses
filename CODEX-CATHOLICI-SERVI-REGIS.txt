    explicitly by this License insofar as it is possible
    to do so.
    
 2. No human being may use any Works governed by this License
    to commit any scandal that would place his neighbor in a 
    proximate occasion of sin, without exception, whatsoever 
    under any circumstances.
    ("Evil", moral evil, see par. 3
    - <https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm>;

 3. All Works governed by this License shall have proper
    attribution according to the terms of the License and
    any license(s) specific to those Works.
    
 4. All Works governed by this License for which any liability
    or liabilities may arise will be justly weighed and
    considered thorouhgly and prudently, and a compromise
    be met according to the truth.
    
 5. This License neither grants nor describes any warranty, but governs
    only what is permissible or not concerning any warranty
    in a Work that is governed by this License. Furthermore,
    if there is no other license mentioned explicitly besides
    this License, then the default license under the respective 
    category of Work found in the repository, 
    <https://github.com/ServiRegis/Licenses>,
    shall be the license for that Work unless that Work should
    adopt a specific license.

II. Provisions:

	1. All Works under the jurisdiction of this license titled, 
		"Codex Catholici Servi Regis" ("License"), shall be subject to 
		the Law.

	2. This License is a Public Work.
	
	3. All copies and derivatives of any and all Works are unique 
		Works, without limitation of discrimination.
	
	4. Under absolutely no circumstances may We, nor any person 
		who has, or has not, attained to the the age of seven 
		years since birth ("Age of Reason"), use any Works 
		governed by this License as a Power to produce any
		scandal that would place his neighbor in a 
    		proximate occasion of sin. 
    	("Evil", moral evil, see par. 3
    	- <https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm>)
		
	5. No unauthorized person may modify the contents of this
		License, nor any copy or derivative of this License.
		
	6. All dispensations from any implicit or explicit Power
		granted to the relevant parties will be decided by
		Us according to reason and according to the Law. 
	
	7. This License, and all copies and derivatives of this 
		License, are subject to necessary modification and
		amendment by Us.
	
III. Rules of Attribution:
	
	1. All Works shall be implicitly attributed to God as the first author,
	    without need for explicit attribution, and must contain a full
	    reproduction, or link to a full reproduction, of this License in
	    every copy or derivative.
	
		a. All Public Works shall be implicitly attributed to God without
		    need for explicit attribution, and at minimum the first and last
		    name ("Full Name") of every author of a Public Work must be
		    present within the Work directly.

			
		b. All Private Works shall be implicitly attributed to God without 
		    need for explicit attribution, and at minimum the Full Name of
		    every author of a Private Work must be present within the Work
		    directly.
		    
		c. If any Work shall transgress the Law in any manner, it may
		    not be attributed to God whatsoever according to any
		    authority. All transgressions of the Law regarding any
		    Work under this License shall be attributed to the
		    appropriate Power(s).
		    
		d. At least one author or maintainer of a Work, followed by an
		    email address succeeding the Full Name of the author or 
		    maintainer, and which email address at least sends all 
		    correspondence directly to the aforementioned author or
		    maintainer, must be provided. Private Works which are not
		    intended to be distributed, or for which a Work is not
		    beyond a reasonable threshold of complexity in its
		    machinery, are exempt from this requirement. In principle,
		    simple Works made of a single contiguous piece such as
		    silverware and apparel are within this threshold.
		
	2. All attributions shall enumerate the Works contained in a
		Work by the person(s) justly according to the proportion 
		for which the person(s) is/are Power(s) of the Work,
		nothing more, and nothing less.
		
	3. All attributions shall be divided into direct attributions
		for the direct Powers of a Work ("Direct Power"), and 
		indirect attributions for Powers that are indirect Powers 
		of a copy or derivative Work ("Indirect Power").
		
			a. The extent of attribution for Indirect Power shall
				be necessary to the first direct ancestor 
				("Parent") of a Power.
				
	4. All derivative Works must provide explicit attribution to
		the creator or creators of the derivative Work.
		
IV. Rules of Liability:

	1. All liabilities are attributable to the names attributed
		to a work, and each party shall be deemed liable in
		proportion to the Work(s) listed in the attribution(s)
		of each party.
		
	2. According to the Law of Justice ("Justice", see 
		<http://newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm>), the Direct
		Powers of a liability shall be held liable for 
		compensation of any damages arising from any
		usage of Our Works contrary to the Law as defined by
		this License.
		
	3. The Power held liable of any usage of Our Works, in 
		accordance with this License that is valid 
		according to the License, and found to be contrary 
		to the Law, shall fall on the creator of this 
		document, Andrew Porter, as the
		Direct Power of the liability with a greater
		proportion of liability than the Power which acted
		according to this license who shall be judged the
		Indirect Power. (For definitions of Direct Power and
		Indirect Power, see "Article V, Section 2.)
	
V. Rules of Warranty:

	1. All liabilities shall be compensated by the
		respective Powers held liable, in full,
		contingent on Our reception of adequate proof of 
		liability, according to the terms of the plaintiff 
		within the constraints of Justice, and the Law,
		and for which the defendant willingly concedes to.
		
	2. The maximum extent of warranty shall be the directly
		liable Power itself ("Direct Power"), and at most the 
		Parent of the directly liable Power shall be held 
		indirectly liable ("Indirect Power").
		
	3. According to Justice, all Work whose value is greater
		than or equal to the value of the liability shall be
		considered sufficient compensation.
		
	4. Repetition of a liability by the same Direct Power
		using the same Work(s) of a previous offense shall
		take full liability with no Indirect Power held
		liable.
		
	5. In an offense per accidens, the Direct Power shall
		be the first ancestor which can be held liable
		for any liabilities, and no other Power will be 
		held liable; and will be subject to the rules
		defined by Section 1 of Article V of this License.
		
	6. Unless otherwise explicitly mentioned, no Work or Works
	        governed by this License provide any warranties or
		guarantees of any kind, neither implicitly nor
		explicitly.
		
VI. Implicit Agreement:

	1. All Powers implicitly agree to the rules of this
		License by any usage of a Work, copy of a Work,
		or derivative of a Work under the juris-
		diction of this License without need of explicit
		agreement.
		
VII. Miscellaneous:

	1. This License may be changed at any time without any
		warranty or notification of change.
		
	2. The Law always supersedes the rules of this License.
	
	3. This License shall be enforced by any and all 
		relevant and capable bodies of government, and to
		the maximum extent permissible by the Law.
