III. Rules of Attribution:
	
	1. All Works shall be implicitly attributed to God as the first author,

	    reproduction, or link to a full reproduction, of this License in
	    every copy or derivative.
	
		a. All Public Works shall be implicitly attributed to God without
		    need for explicit attribution, and at minimum the first and last
		    name ("Full Name") of every author of a Public Work must be
		    present within the Work directly.
			
		b. All Private Works shall be implicitly attributed to God alone
		    without need for explicit attribution.

		c. If any Work shall transgress the Law in any manner, it may

		    Work under this License shall be attributed to the
		    appropriate Power(s).
		
	2. All attributions shall enumerate the Works contained in a

		for which the person(s) is/are Power(s) of the Work,
		nothing more, and nothing less.

		for the direct Powers of a Work ("Direct Power"), and 
		indirect attributions for Powers that are indirect Powers 
		of a copy or derivative Work ("Indirect Power").
		
			a. The extent of attribution for Indirect Power shall
				be necessary to the first direct ancestor 
				("Parent") of a Power.
				
	4. All derivative Works must provide explicit attribution to
		the creator or creators of the derivative Work.
		
IV. Rules of Liability:

	1. All liabilities are attributable to the names attributed
		to a work, and each party shall be deemed liable in
		proportion to the Work(s) listed in the attribution(s)
		of each party.
		
	2. According to the Law of Justice ("Justice", see 
		<http://newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm>), the Direct
		Powers of a liability shall be held liable for 
		compensation of any damages arising from any
		usage of Our Works contrary to the Law as defined by
		this License.
		
	3. The Power held liable of any usage of Our Works, in 
		accordance with this License that is valid 
		according to the License, and found to be contrary 
		to the Law, shall fall on the creator of this 
		document, Andrew Porter, as the
		Direct Power of the liability with a greater
		proportion of liability than the Power which acted
		according to this license who shall be judged the
		Indirect Power. (For definitions of Direct Power and
		Indirect Power, see "Article V, Section 2.)
	
V. Rules of Warranty:

	1. All liabilities shall be compensated by the
		respective Powers held liable, in full,

		liability, according to the terms of the plaintiff 
		within the constraints of Justice, and the Law,
		and for which the defendant willingly concedes to.

		liable Power itself ("Direct Power"), and at most the 
		Parent of the directly liable Power shall be held 
		indirectly liable ("Indirect Power").
		
	3. According to Justice, all Work whose value is greater
		than or equal to the value of the liability shall be
		considered sufficient compensation.
		
	4. Repetition of a liability by the same Direct Power
		using the same Work(s) of a previous offense shall
		take full liability with no Indirect Power held
		liable.
		
	5. In an offense per accidens, the Direct Power shall
		be the first ancestor which can be held liable
		for any liabilities, and no other Power will be 
		held liable; and will be subject to the rules
		defined by Section 1 of Article V of this License.
		
	6. Unless otherwise explicitly mentioned, no Work or Works
	        governed by this License provide any warranties or
		guarantees of any kind, neither implicitly nor
		explicitly.
		
VI. Implicit Agreement:

		License by any usage of a Work, copy of a Work,
		or derivative of a Work under the juris-
		diction of this License without need of explicit
		agreement.

		warranty or notification of change.
